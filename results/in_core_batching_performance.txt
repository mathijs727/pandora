Sponza Crytek / path tracing (max depth = 10)

Everything was run in Release mode

Reference performance:
WiVe8B8: ~3500ms
Embree:  ~3950ms

Initial implementation (2048 prims per leaf, 1024 rays per batch)
Flush after all primary rays are inserted; keep flushing while there are non-empty batches. Before each flush iteration sort (in parallel) the leaf nodes based on the number of batches. For each node (in parallel) flush each batch (in parallel, so a single node with a lot of batches does not become a bottleneck). Batch read/writes are protected with a read/write lock so that we can safely change the current batch pointer. Writing in a batch happens using an atomic index (and some thread local indexing to prevent accessing the shared index on each access).
Result: ~10500ms

According to VTune waiting for the read/write lock that protects the current batch (from getting swapped when it gets full) takes more time than any of the traversal functions.



Replacing locks by atomics
Result: ~6300ms

Disabling sorting rays before processing them
Result: ~6000ms

Remove the valid checking for each item in a batch (not necessary when batches are filled from left to right)
Result: ~5700ms

Fill batches in thread-local memory (using smaller batches of 64 rays) and split flush function in leaf traversal + top level traversal (inserting rays into new batches).
Result: ~5000ms
